## 🏗️ FSD Architecture Compliance

### Layers Modified:
- [x] `entities/` - Business entities
- [ ] `features/` - Business features
- [ ] `widgets/` - Complex UI blocks
- [ ] `shared/` - Shared utilities
- [ ] `app/` - Application layer

### Architecture Checklist:
- [x] Follows FSD dependency rules (App → Widgets → Features → Entities → Shared)
- [x] No circular dependencies introduced
- [x] Proper layer separation maintained
- [x] Entity exports are clean and focused
- [x] Business logic is properly separated from UI

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage:
- [x] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated

- [x] Manual testing completed

### Test Results:
```bash
# Unit tests for rollout helpers
✓ validatePercentage - validates correct percentages
✓ calculateAffectedUsers - calculates affected users correctly  
✓ isUserInRollout - consistent user distribution
✓ getRolloutStatusColor - returns correct colors
✓ getRolloutStatusText - returns correct status text
✓ getNextRolloutStep - returns next rollout step
✓ getPreviousRolloutStep - returns previous rollout step
✓ formatRolloutStrategy - formats strategy names

## 🔍 Additional Notes

This PR implements the foundation for rollout functionality. The entity includes:

### Key Features:
- **Multiple rollout strategies**: PERCENTAGE, USER_BASED, GEOGRAPHIC, TIME_BASED
- **Percentage validation**: Ensures valid 0-100% values
- **User distribution**: Consistent hash-based user assignment
- **Status tracking**: Color-coded status and text helpers
- **Step management**: Next/previous rollout step helpers

### Next Steps:
- Issue #2: Implement rollout feature layer
- Issue #3: Create user targeting entity
- Issue #4: Implement user targeting rules

### Database Schema:
The Rollout model includes proper relations with Toggle and User models, with cascade delete for data integrity.
