## ðŸ“Š Project Board Setup

After creating issues:

1. **Go to your project**: https://github.com/users/pradiktabagus/projects/5
2. **Add columns** if not already created:
   - ðŸ“‹ Backlog
   - ðŸ”„ Ready  
   - ðŸš§ In Progress
   - ðŸ‘€ In Review
   - âœ… Done
3. **Add issues to Backlog column**
4. **Set up column automation**:
   - Backlog: Auto-add new issues
   - In Progress: Auto-add when assigned
   - In Review: Auto-add PRs
   - Done: Auto-add when PR merged

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Create the labels** listed above
2. **Create the 4 issues** using the issue templates
3. **Add issues to your project board**
4. **Create a milestone** for Phase 2
5. **Start with Issue #1** (Rollout Entity)

Your GitHub project automation should now work correctly with the updated workflow! ðŸš€
